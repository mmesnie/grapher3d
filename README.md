   i. Abstract
   
   Grapher-3D generates surfaces from two variable functions
   and/or arbitrary data points allowing users to view these 
   surfaces from any three dimensional position.  Dynamic axis
   rotation and domain shifting help better illustrate the surface. 

   "grapher3d" will start the application.
