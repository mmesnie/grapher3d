This is the first non-X11 implementation of grapher3d, based on
libsvga (http://svgalib.org/). Circa 1994.

Compiles and runs OK on Fedora 8. Linux version 2.6.23.1-42.fc8.

My need to uncomment this in /etc/libvga.config

NoHelper            # Disable use of the helper-kernelmodule (/dev/svga) and
                    # fallback to old ioperm/iopl and /dev/mem use.
